Getting an order
================

GlobalFood offers two integration methods for getting new orders:

- Push (Cloud system)
- Poll (Local system)


Push (Cloud system)
----------------------

This type of integration is recommended for systems with a centralized architecture. In this scenario an endpoint is notified via webhook that one or more orders have been accepted for one or more of the system's client restaurants.


**You need to provide us with:**

1. A public HTTPS endpoint that interprets our calls over the POST method
   eg: https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem

2. Tell us which format you like (XML or JSON)



**Map orders to correct restaurants:**

You need to identify which restaurant you need to assign an order to. Every order that we push to you contains the <restaurant_key> parameter which is unique to each restaurant location. We will provide you this key manually via email once you have created that restaurant in our system. Simply tell us the email address that you used to create the account within our system. You can see in the XML & JSON example below that the example key is 8yCPCvb3dDo1k.



**Add optional security:**

By default we send a master key alongside each request in the "Authorization" (example: e6fIguVkyG5xtT3BYGMI4rfm9iVt24YJ) header of the request. This key can be used by you to verify that the sender is us. Otherwise any third party that knows your URL https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem could try to push a "fake" order.


### Example using JSON

We will call
```
POST https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem
```
with the payload found in [examples](./payload/json/)



### Example using XML

We will call
 ```
POST https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem
```
with the payload found in [examples](./payload/xml/)


Poll (Local system)
----------------------

This type of integration is recommended for systems with a decentralized architecture. In this scenario the restaurant devices does not communicate with a central endpoint for notifications. The devices poll our server every minute to check for new confirmed order notifications. An example for "Polling" is when the device is behind a firewall inside the restaurant location and does not have a connection with a server in the cloud.  When using polling, the orders will be available for an unlimited amount of time until being requested by the device.


**We need to provide you:**

A secret key to allow you to poll our system. This key must be sent in the "Authorization" header of the request. This key is unique for every restaurant location. (Example: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k). We will provide you this key manually via email once you have created that restaurant in our system. Simply tell us the email address that you used to create the account with in our system.


**Polling:**

1. The endpoint for polling is: https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop
2. Method is POST
3. API version must be set to: 2
4. You can select the format (xml or json) by setting the "Accept" header to either "application/xml" or "application/json". Default is JSON.


### Example using JSON
```
curl "https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop" \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Glf-Api-Version: 2"
```

See [examples](./payload/json/) for response payload


### Example using XML
```
curl "https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop" \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k" \
   -H "Accept: application/xml"  \
   -H "Glf-Api-Version: 2"
```

See [examples](./payload/xml/) for response payload


Order fields
------------

**DISCLAIMER:**
Results may contain some fields which are not documented here. This means that they are deprecated or only used internally. They are in the process of being removed from the Accepted Orders API. The last section includes a list of relevant fields so please expect and store only those.


**NOTES:**
- all rates are decimals, meaning that 20% will be stored as 0.2 and 0.725% will be stored as 0.00725
- some fields can contain null; in JSON null is treated as a separate type, in XML it's a self-closing element; the meaning of null is "field has not been used"
