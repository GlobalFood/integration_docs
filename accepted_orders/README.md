GlobalFood Accepted Orders API (Version 2)
=====================================

Getting an order
================

GlobalFood offers two integration methods for getting new orders:

- Push (Cloud system)
- Poll (Local system)


Push (Cloud system)
----------------------

This type of integration is recommended for systems with a centralized architecture. In this scenario, an endpoint is notified via webhook that one or more orders have been accepted for one or more of the system's client restaurants.


**You need to provide us with:**

1. A public HTTPS endpoint that interprets our calls over the POST method
   eg: https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem

2. Tell us which format you like (XML or JSON)



**Map orders to correct restaurants:**

You need to identify which restaurant you need to assign an order to. Every order that we push to you contains the <restaurant_key> parameter which is unique to each restaurant location. To get your own key, navigate to the integrations section and add an integration using the "Push Accepted Order" template. You should see the key in the integrations listing after adding it. You can see in the XML & JSON example below that the example key is 8yCPCvb3dDo1k.



**Add optional security:**

By default we send a master key alongside each request in the "Authorization" (example: e6fIguVkyG5xtT3BYGMI4rfm9iVt24YJ) header of the request. This key can be used by you to verify that the sender is us. Otherwise any third party that knows your URL https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem could try to push a "fake" order.


**WARNINGS:**

1. The endpoint called by our system MUST reply within a maximum of 15 seconds.

2. In some rare cases, it is possible to receive two notifications for the same order. This means that the notifications contain the same order id and pos_system_id. You MUST implement a protection against this special case.


### Example using JSON

We will call
```
POST https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem
```
with the payload found in [examples](./payload/json/)



### Example using XML

We will call
 ```
POST https://www.your-domain.com/integration/orderingsystem
```
with the payload found in [examples](./payload/xml/)


Poll (Local system)
----------------------

This type of integration is recommended for systems with a decentralized architecture. In this scenario the restaurant devices does not communicate with a central endpoint for notifications. The devices poll our server every minute to check for new confirmed order notifications. An example for "Polling" is when the device is behind a firewall inside the restaurant location and does not have a connection with a server in the cloud.  When using polling, the orders will be available for an unlimited amount of time until being requested by the device.


**We need to provide you:**

A secret key to allow you to poll our system. This key must be sent in the "Authorization" header of the request. This key is unique for every restaurant location. (Example: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k). To get your own key, navigate to the integrations section and add an integration using the "Poll Accepted Order v2" template. You should see the key in the integrations listing after adding it


**Polling:**

1. The endpoint for polling is: https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop
2. Method is POST
3. API version must be set to: 2
4. You can select the format (xml or json) by setting the "Accept" header to either "application/xml" or "application/json". Default is JSON.


### Example using JSON
```
curl "https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop" \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Glf-Api-Version: 2"
```

See [examples](./payload/json/) for response payload


### Example using XML
```
curl "https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/order/pop" \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k" \
   -H "Accept: application/xml"  \
   -H "Glf-Api-Version: 2"
```

See [examples](./payload/xml/) for response payload


Order fields
------------

**DISCLAIMER:**
Results may contain some fields which are not documented here. This means that they are deprecated or only used internally. They are in the process of being removed from the Accepted Orders API. The last section includes a list of relevant fields so please expect and store only those.


**NOTES:**
- all rates are decimals, meaning that 20% will be stored as 0.2 and 0.725% will be stored as 0.00725
- some fields can contain null; in JSON null is treated as a separate type, in XML it's a self-closing element; the meaning of null is "field has not been used"


### Order Collections

The fields of an order collection are:

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|count  |integer         | number of orders to be fetched by the system|
|orders |array of orders | list of the orders|


### Orders

The fields of an order are:

| Field                        | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
